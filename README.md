### Stringify
Using Karma + Jasmine for unit tests.
Currently all primitive types and Array, Number, Boolean, String, Object objects are supported

### To be clarified
* constructing objects using "prototype" property
* constructing objects using "new" keyword
* if each function is an object then they're not stored in stack and buffer overflow is impossible?
